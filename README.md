# Email-Application
Hello!

This is my email application written in Java using IntelliJ IDEA. The java files are in the SRC folder and the class files are in the OUT folder.

Scenario: You are an IT Support Specialist and are tasked with creating an email for any new hires. In this case, The Email class implements an interface and provides all the basic functions of creating an email, given first name, last name, company, department, etc.. Also generates a password and allows the user to choose to change the password. I provided a tempmain to show how the program is meant to work. This is my first side project. All the files are included in order to run the program if you so choose.
